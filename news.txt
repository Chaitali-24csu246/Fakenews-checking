US President Donald Trump addressed Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, on Monday, declaring that “the long and painful nightmare is finally over” after helping broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Trump told cheering lawmakers, “This long and difficult war has ended. In an unprecedented achievement, virtually the entire region has endorsed the plan that Gaza will be demilitarised and Hamas will be disarmed, and Israel's security will not be threatened.”
